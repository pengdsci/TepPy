   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "The Python syntax is clear, concise, and focused on readability. Readability is arguably one of the more attractive features of the language itself. It makes Python ideal for people who are learning to program. In this section, we’ll learn about several important components of the Python syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1. Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments are pieces of text that live in our code but are ignored by the Python interpreter as it executes the code. We can use comments to describe the code so that we and other developers can quickly understand what the code does or why the code is written in a given way. To write a comment in Python, just add a hash mark (#) before your comment text:\n",
    "\n",
    "```    \n",
    "# This is a long comment that requires\n",
    "# two lines to be complete.\n",
    "```\n",
    "        \n",
    "    \n",
    "### 3.2. Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, variables are names attached to a particular object. They hold a reference, or pointer, to the memory address at which an object is stored. Once a variable is assigned an object, we can access the object using the variable name. We need to define our variables in advance. Here’s the syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "variable_name = variable_value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We should use a naming scheme that makes our variables intuitive and readable. The variable name should provide some indication as to what the values assigned to it are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes programmers use short variable names, such as x and y. These are perfectly suitable names in the context of math, algebra, and so on. In other contexts, we should avoid single-character names and use something more descriptive. That way, other developers can make an educated guess of what our variables hold. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Some naming convention in Python`: Our variable names can be any length and can consist of uppercase and lowercase letters (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9), and also the underscore character (_). In sum, variable names should be alphanumeric, but note that even though variable names can contain digits, their first character can’t be a digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `lower_case_with_underscores` naming convention, also known as snake_case, is commonly used in Python. It isn’t enforced, but it’s a widely adopted standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3. Keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "Like any other programming language, Python has a set of special words that are part of its syntax. These words are known as keywords. To get the complete list of keywords available in our current Python installation, we can run the following code in an interactive session:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "help(\"keywords\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a list of the Python keywords.  Enter any keyword to get more help.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "False               class               from                or\n",
    "None                continue            global              pass\n",
    "True                def                 if                  raise\n",
    "and                 del                 import              return\n",
    "as                  elif                in                  try\n",
    "assert              else                is                  while\n",
    "async               except              lambda              with\n",
    "await               finally             nonlocal            yield\n",
    "break               for                 not\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these keywords plays a role in Python syntax. They are reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes in the language, so we shouldn’t use them for anything but those specific purposes. For example, we shouldn’t use them as variable names in our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4. Built-in data types\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a handful of built-in data types, such as numbers (integers, floats, complex numbers), Booleans, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. We can manipulate them with several tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Operators\n",
    "* Built-in functions\n",
    "* Data type methods\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### <font color = \"darkred\"><b>A. Numbers</b></font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers. Integers and floating-point numbers are the most commonly used numeric types in day-to-day programming, while complex numbers have specific use cases in math and science. Here’s a summary of their features:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Number\t|Description\t|Examples\t|Python Data Type|\n",
    "|:-----:|:-------------:|:---------:|:--------------:|\n",

    "|Complex|\tNumbers with a real part and an imaginary part|\tcomplex(1, 2), complex(-1, 7), complex(\"1+2j\")\t|complex|\n",
    "\n",
    "Integer numbers have unlimited precision. Floating-point numbers’ precision information is available in` sys.float_info`. Complex numbers have a real part and an imaginary part, which are both floating-point numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color = \"darkred\"><b>B. Operators</b></font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Operators represent operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and so on. When we combine them with numbers, they form expressions that Python can evaluate.\n"
